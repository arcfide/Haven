  <p>The APL Haven is a full-stack, all-inclusive help system for Dyalog APL. 
  It is designed to help you get the answers to your questions fast, and to learn 
  how to get things done in APL even faster. For too long, the answers to how to do
  things in APL have been scattered across the Internet, often in hard to find places 
  and in formats that are hard to use. No longer.</p>

  <p>We use the official Dyalog APL 
  documentation sources to build an accessible portal into all things APL, so you can 
  trust that the answers you get aren't just someone's opinion on the Internet,
  but the real deal. We've also extended the documentation with targeted FAQ's, 
  idiom lists, how-to's, and a host of other educational and learning resources to help
  you get the most out of the extensive Dyalog APL ecosystem.</p>

           href="fullstack">
  <p>We believe in practising what we preach, and helping people learn while doing so. 
  That's why the APL Haven was designed from the ground up as a full-stack APL 
  application using the most modern and up-to-date APL techniques and methods, using 
  modern APL design patterns. If you've ever wondered what a modern, web and 
  mobile-first, data-driven APL application looks like, look no further.</p>

  <p>The entire source for Haven is available to learn and build upon, so you can see what 
  an APL application looks like from back-end to front-end and everything in between.</p>
